# Complete Journey to become AI Engineer with Python
### Instructions: 
Learn about the YouTube's influencers scams ðŸ’€. Here is a link of the documentary to learn about the scams of the youtubers: [Scams](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hemvad_scams-edtech-india-activity-7141404088591683586-MLwC/)

Before you're going to do programming learn about the computer and its networks and how data is process in computers like binary representation. Here is a course link: [Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/computers-101)

`Must Learn` these things before doing the programming. For AI Engineering you need to complete just 4 units.
## Roadmap of python programming language.
### 1. Python for Begineers (1-2 weeks)
The roadmap is following 
1. Basic Syntax of python.
Here is a link to learn the basic python: [Click](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)

2. Variables and data types in python.
Here is a link to learn the variables and data-types in python: [Link](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)

3. Conditionals: Here is a link to learn the coditionals in python: [Click](https://www.guru99.com/if-loop-python-conditional-structures.html)   also check the code file as well `master_if_cond.py` in python complete folder.
  - First exercise of python programming is here [Description](https://github.com/AhmedShafique313/AI_Engineer-with-python/blob/main/Python%20Complete/Exercise%20Solutions/sugar-level-description.md) 

4. Loops: Go to the folder `python Begineers` and see different files starting from `loop1.py to loop4.py` run them and check what's happening.ðŸ¤”

5. Type Casting: Here is link to learn type casting in python and there are two types of Type Casting in python `Implict` and `Explict`. [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/type-conversion-and-casting)

6. Functions: Two type of functions. `built-in` functions and `user define` functions. Here are the links of both type of functions. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp) [python_org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)


7. Lists in python: Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python. [TheNewStack](https://thenewstack.io/python-for-beginners-lists/) or from [Jerrynsh](https://jerrynsh.com/tuples-vs-lists-vs-sets-in-python/) 

8. Tuples: A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable. [TheNewStack](https://thenewstack.io/python-for-beginners-when-and-how-to-use-tuples/) 

9. Sets: A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. Pythonâ€™s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set. [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) or [LearnPython](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-sets/)

10. Dictionary: In python, Dictionary is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)

`Project` Online Store management system using python beginners concept. You'll find the project description in this folder [Description](https://github.com/AhmedShafique313/AI_Engineer-with-python/blob/main/Python%20Beginners/Project/project_description.md)

### 2. Python for Intermediate
1. Json: Javascript Object Notation. Go to the link to learn about the json library in python and enjoy happy learning. Here is a link to learn. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_json.asp) or from [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/json) or from [RealPython](https://realpython.com/python-json/)
