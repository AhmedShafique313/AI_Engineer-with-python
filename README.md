# Complete Journey to become AI Engineer with Python
### Instructions: 
Learn about the YouTube's influencers scams ðŸ’€. Here is a link of the documentary to learn about the scams of the youtubers: [Scams](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hemvad_scams-edtech-india-activity-7141404088591683586-MLwC/)

Before you're going to do programming learn about the computer and its networks and how data is process in computers like binary representation. Here is a course link: [Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles/computers-101)

`Must Learn` these things before doing the programming. For AI Engineering you need to complete just 4 units.
### Roadmap of python programming language.
The roadmap is following 
1. Basic Syntax of python.
Here is a link to learn the basic python: [Click](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/)

2. Variables and data types in python.
Here is a link to learn the variables and data-types in python: [Link](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)

3. Conditionals: Here is a link to learn the coditionals in python: [Click](https://www.guru99.com/if-loop-python-conditional-structures.html)   also check the code file as well `master_if_cond.py` in python complete folder.
  - First exercise of python programming is here [Description](https://github.com/AhmedShafique313/AI_Engineer-with-python/blob/main/Python%20Complete/Exercise%20Solutions/sugar-level-description.md) 

4. Loops: Go to the folder `python complete` and see different files starting from `loop1.py to loop4.py` run them and check what's happening.ðŸ¤”

5. Type Casting: Here is link to learn type casting in python and there are two types of Type Casting in python `Implict` and `Explict`. [Click](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/type-conversion-and-casting)
